### A Few of My Favorite Things 

- Dev Technologies : Shouldn't have started with this one but I love backend and infrastructure (I see containerization and orchestration on my horizon!)
- Favorite Project of mine so far: Deck Builder.   [_View_](https://moses-ian-deck-builder.herokuapp.com/) 
- Hobby: Music!! Been writing since I was a child.   [_Some Jingles_](https://soundcloud.com/vulture-colorado)


### What is next for me ?
- the world of containerization! I'll be able to create whole worlds! 
- Solidifying my current knowledgebase by making... anything! (always open to ideas!)
- Learning UE5. Slightly beyond the horizon but then i'd REALLY be able to create my own world!
